**Project Overview**  
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions globally, representing a significant public health challenge. Characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, diabetes can lead to severe health complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and blindness if not properly managed. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports a steady increase in the prevalence of diabetes, underscoring its critical importance in medical research and public health intervention.

**Problem Area**  
Many individuals remain undiagnosed due to limited access to medical testing. Leveraging data science presents an opportunity to predict diabetes risk using readily available health data, thereby addressing the gap in early detection and diagnosis.

**Importance of Early Detection**  
Early detection and diagnosis of diabetes are crucial for effective management and prevention of severe complications. Identifying the disease in its initial stages allows healthcare providers to implement strategies for controlling blood sugar levels, promoting healthy lifestyle changes, and reducing the risk of complications. Early intervention not only improves the quality of life for individuals with diabetes but also decreases the overall burden on healthcare systems.

**Data Science Solution**  
Implementing a predictive model can provide early warnings and promote proactive healthcare measures. By analyzing various factors that contribute to the onset and progression of diabetes, the project aims to develop robust predictive models to identify individuals at risk.

**Dataset Description**  
The dataset comprises 100,000 rows and 9 columns, with 3,854 duplicate rows and no null values. It includes two categorical columns and seven numerical columns. The columns are:
- gender: Gender of the individual (Female or Male)
- age: Age of the individual
- hypertension: Presence of hypertension (1 for yes, 0 for no)
- heart_disease: Presence of heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no)
- smoking_history: Smoking history of the individual
- bmi: Body Mass Index of the individual
- HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level
- blood_glucose_level: Blood glucose level
- diabetes: Target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1 for yes, 0 for no)

**Modeling Approach**  
The project utilizes logistic regression and decision tree models with techniques such as upsampling, downsampling, and SMOTE. Additionally, more complex models like Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost are optimized using GridSearchCV. These models are trained on the dataset to identify patterns and correlations among various risk factors, ultimately providing accurate predictions of diabetes risk.

**Expected Outcomes**  
The research is expected to yield valuable insights into the early detection and prevention of diabetes. By identifying key risk factors and their interactions, the study aims to:
- Develop targeted screening programs for high-risk populations.
- Inform public health policies and prevention strategies.
- Enhance patient education and self-management practices.
- Contribute to the development of personalized treatment plans.

This project highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to understanding and combating diabetes, aiming to reduce its prevalence and improve the health and well-being of affected individuals.
